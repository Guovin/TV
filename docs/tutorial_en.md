## Step 1: Fork this Repository

Copy the source code of this repository to your personal account repository

### 1. Click Fork on the homepage:

![Fork Entrance](./images/fork-btn.png 'Fork Entrance')

### 2. Fork to create a personal repository:

1. Name your personal repository, you can name it whatever you like (the final live source result link depends on this name), here we use default TV as an example.
2. After confirming the information is correct, click to confirm and create.

## Step 2: Update the Source Code

Since this project will continue to iterate and improve, if you want to get the latest updates, you can do the following:

### 1. Star

Go to https://github.com/Guovin/iptv-api, click on Star to bookmark this project (Your Star is my motivation to keep updating).
![Star](./images/star.png 'Star')

### 2. Watch

Follow this project to be notified by email about the latest updates and release logs through releases.

### 3. Sync fork

#### Normal update:

Go back to the homepage of your repository after forking. If there are updates to the project, click on "Sync fork" and then "Update branch" to confirm and update to the latest code.
![Sync-fork](./images/sync-fork.png 'Sync fork')

#### No Update branch button, update conflict:

This is because some files conflict with the default files in the main repository. Click "Discard commits" to update to the latest code.
![Conflict Resolution](./images/conflict.png 'Conflict Resolution')

## Step 3: Modify the Template

When you click to confirm and create in step one, you will be automatically redirected to your personal repository. At this point, your personal repository is created, and you can customize your personal live source channel menu!

### 1. Click the demo.txt template file inside the config folder:

![demo.txt Entrance](./images/demo-btn.png 'demo.txt Entrance')

### 2. Create a personal template user_demo.txt inside the config folder:

1. Create file
2. Name the template file user_demo.txt
3. The template file needs to be written in the format of (channel category, #genre#), (channel name, channel interface), note that it is an English comma. If you need to set this interface as a whitelist (no speed testing, kept at the front of the results), simply add $! after the address. For example: http://xxx$!. Additional information can also be appended afterward, such as: http://xxx$! Whitelist interface.
4. Click Commit changes... to save

![Create user_demo.txt](./images/edit-user-demo.png 'Create user_demo.txt')

## Step 4: Modify the Configuration

Similar to editing the template, modify the running configuration

### 1. Click on the config.ini configuration file inside the config folder:

![config.ini Entrance](./images/config-btn.png 'config.ini Entrance')

### 2. Copy the default configuration file content:

![Copy config.ini](./images/copy-config.png 'Copy default template')

### 3. Create a personal configuration file user_config.ini inside the config folder:

1. Create file
2. Name the configuration file user_config.ini
3. Paste the default template
4. Modify the template and result file configuration:
   - source_file = config/user_demo.txt
   - final_file = output/user_result.txt
5. Click Commit changes... to save

![Create user_config.ini](./images/edit-user-config.png 'Create user_config.ini')

Adjust the configuration as needed. Below is the default configuration explanation:
[Config parameter](./docs/config_en.md)

## Step 5: Run Updates

## Method 1: Workflow

#### Warning: Please use the following content with caution. If you have a large number of channels that need to be updated, please use local updates instead of automatic updates. Improper configuration may lead to your account or workflow being banned!

If your template and configuration modifications are correct, you can configure Actions to achieve automatic updates

### 1. Enter Actions:

![Actions Entrance](./images/actions-btn.png 'Actions Entrance')

### 2. Enable Actions workflow:

![Enable Actions workflow](./images/actions-enable.png 'Enable Actions workflow')
Since the Actions workflow of the forked repository is disabled by default, you need to manually enable it by clicking the button in the red box to confirm.

![Actions workflow enabled successfully](./images/actions-home.png 'Actions workflow enabled successfully')
After successful activation, you can see that there are no workflows running at the moment. Don't worry, let's start running your first update workflow below.

### 3. Run the update workflow:

#### (1) Enable update schedule:

1. Click on update schedule under the Workflows category.
2. Since the workflow of the forked repository is disabled by default, click the Enable workflow button to confirm the activation.

![Enable Workflows update](./images/workflows-btn.png 'Enable Workflows update')

#### (2) Run the Workflow based on branches:

1. Click Run workflow.
2. Here you can switch to the branch you want to run. Since the fork defaults to the master branch, if the template and configuration you modified are also in the master branch, just choose master here, and click Run workflow to confirm the run.

![Run Workflow](./images/workflows-run.png 'Run Workflow')
Now you can run the update workflow.

#### (3) Workflow in progress:

Wait a moment, and you will see that your first update workflow is running!
(Note: The running time depends on the number of channels and pages in your template and other configurations, and also largely depends on the current network conditions. Please be patient. The default template and configuration usually take about 25 minutes.)
![Workflow in progress](./images/workflow-running.png 'Workflow in progress')

#### (4) Cancel the running Workflow:

If you feel that this update is not quite right and you need to modify the template or configuration before running again, you can click Cancel run to cancel this run.
![Cancel running Workflow](./images/workflow-cancel.png 'Cancel running Workflow')

#### (5) Workflow executed successfully:

If everything is normal, after a short wait, you will see that the workflow has been executed successfully (green check mark).
![Workflow executed successfully](./images/workflow-success.png 'Workflow executed successfully')

At this point, you can visit the proxy file link to see if the latest results have been synchronized:
https://ghp.ci/raw.githubusercontent.com/your github username/repository name (corresponding to the TV created when forking)/master/user_result.txt
![Username and Repository Name](./images/rep-info.png 'Username and Repository Name')

If you can access this link and it returns the updated interface content, then your live source interface link has been successfully created! Simply copy and paste this link into software like TVBox in the configuration field to use~

- Note: Except for the first execution of the workflow, which requires you to manually trigger it, subsequent executions (default: 6:00 AM and 18:00 PM Beijing time daily) will be automatically triggered. If you have modified the template or configuration files and want to execute the update immediately, you can manually trigger (2) Run workflow.

### 4.Modify Workflow Update Frequency(optional)

If you want to modify the update frequency (default: 6:00 AM and 18:00 PM Beijing time daily), you can modify the on:schedule:- cron field.
![.github/workflows/main.yml](./images/schedule-cron.png '.github/workflows/main.yml')
If you want to perform updates every 2 days, you can modify it like this:

```bash
- cron: '0 22 */2 * *'
- cron: '0 10 */2 * *'
```

#### 1. It is strongly not recommended to modify and update too frequently, because the interface content does not differ within a short period of time, and too high update frequency and time-consuming workflow may be judged as resource abuse, resulting in the risk of warehouse and account being blocked.

#### 2. Please pay attention to the runtime of your workflow. If you find that the execution time is too long, you need to appropriately reduce the number of channels in the template, modify the number of pages and interfaces in the configuration, in order to meet the compliant operation requirements.

### Method 2: Command Line

1. Install Python
   Please download and install Python from the official site. During installation, choose to add Python to the system's environment variables Path.

2. Run Update
   Open a CMD terminal in the project directory and run the following commands in sequence:

```python
pip install pipenv
```

```python
pipenv install --dev
```

Start update:

```python
pipenv run dev
```

Start service:

```python
pipenv run service
```

### Method 3: GUI Software

1. Download [IPTV-API software](https://github.com/Guovin/iptv-api/releases), open the software, click update to complete the update.

2. Alternatively, run the following command in the project directory to open the GUI software:

```python
pipenv run ui
```

![IPTV-API software](./images/ui.png 'IPTV-API software')

### Method 4: Docker

- iptv-api (Full version): Higher performance requirements, slower update speed, high stability and success rate. Set open_driver = False to switch to the lite running mode (recommended for hotel sources, multicast sources, and online searches)
- iptv-api:lite (Condensed version): Lightweight, low performance requirements, fast update speed, stability uncertain (recommend using this version for the subscription source)

It's recommended to try each one and choose the version that suits you

1. Pull the image:

- iptv-api

```bash
docker pull guovern/iptv-api:latest
```

- iptv-api:lite

```bash
docker pull guovern/iptv-api:lite
```

2. Run the container:

- iptv-api

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 guovern/iptv-api
```

- iptv-api:lite

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 guovern/iptv-api:lite
```

Volume Mount Parameter (Optional):
This allows synchronization of files between the host machine and the container. Modifying templates, configurations, and retrieving updated result files can be directly operated in the host machine's folder.

Taking the host path /etc/docker as an example:

- iptv-api：

```bash
docker run -v /etc/docker/config:/iptv-api/config -v /etc/docker/output:/iptv-api/output -d -p 8000:8000 guovern/iptv-api
```

- iptv-api:lite：

```bash
docker run -v /etc/docker/config:/iptv-api-lite/config -v /etc/docker/output:/iptv-api-lite/output -d -p 8000:8000 guovern/iptv-api:lite
```

3. Update results:

- API address: ip:8000
- M3u api：ip:8000/m3u
- Txt api：ip:8000/txt
- API content: ip:8000/content
- Speed test log: ip:8000/log

### Update the File to the Repository(optional)

If you do not have your own domain address, after the interface update is completed, upload user_result.txt to your personal repository to use it.
https://ghp.ci/raw.githubusercontent.com/your github username/repository name (corresponding to the TV created when forking)/master/output/user_result.txt
![Username and Repository Name](./images/rep-info.png 'Username and Repository Name')
